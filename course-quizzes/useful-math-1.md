# Useful Math 1 (numbers, exponents, logarithms) wip

1. Express $2 \cdot 2^2$ as a power of $2$

$$2\cdot 2^2 = 2^1 \cdot 2^2 = 2^{1+2}=2^3$$

#

2. For $b > 1$ and $N,M > 0$, which is true?

* $log_b(NM)=(log_bN)+(log_bM)$

* $log_b(N+M)=(log_bN)(log_bM)$

* $log_b(NM)=(log_bN)(log_bM)$

* $log_b(N+M)=(log_bN)+(log_bM)$

<br/>

#

3. What would be a useful convention for what $b^0$ should mean?

* $0$ if $b \not =0$
* $1$ if $b \not =0$ ✔️
* undefined
* infinity 

I'm pretty sure its the second option.

#

4. Express $2^{n-1} + 2^{n-1}$ as a power of 2.

$$
\begin{align*}
2^{n-1}+2^{n-1} &= 2\cdot 2^{n-1} \\
&= 2^1 \cdot 2^{n-1} \\
&= 2^{n-1+1} \\
&= 2^n
\end{align*}
$$

#

5. Which is true?

* $log_b(N^x)=x \, log_b \, N$ ✔️
* $log_b(N^x)=(log_b \, N)^x$

#

6. Find $lg \frac{1}{4}$

#

7. Find $lg$ $1024$

#

8. What is $log_b \, b^x$

#

9. Find $lg$ $8$

#

10. What is $lg \, 2^x$

#

13. What is the number $10010$ in base 10?

<br/>

$$(2^4 \cdot 1)+(2^3 \cdot 0)+(2^2 \cdot 0)+(2^1 \cdot 1)+(2^0 \cdot 0)=18$$

#

14. Multiply the binary numbers $100101$ and $1011$ using the school algorithm for multiplication. How many carries occurred during the addition?

#

15. True of false: $log_a \, N = log_b \, N/log_b \, a$ ?

#

16. For $n,m \geq 1$, true or false: $b^{n+m}=b^nb^m$

#

17. Express (the decimal value) 8 in binary.

<br/>

$$8_{10}=(2^3 \cdot 1)+(2^2 \cdot 0)+(2^1 \cdot 0)+(2^0 \cdot 0)=1000_2$$

#

18. What is $log_b$ $b$ ?

<br/>

We are asked what number to raise $b$ to the power of in order to get $b$, which is 1.

#

19. Express $2^{2^2}$ as a power of $2$

<br/>

$$2^{2^2} = 2^{2\cdot 2} = 2^{4}$$

#

20. Express $(2^2)^3$ as a power of $2$

<br/>

$$(2^2)^3 = 2^2 \cdot 2^2 \cdot 2^2 = 2^{2+2+2} = 2^6$$

Better to use rule of exponentiation of exponentiation:

$$(2^2)^3 = 2^{2 \cdot 3}=2^6$$

#

21. For $b > 1$ and $n,m \geq 1$, which is true?

* $b^{nm}=(b^n)^m$ ✔️
* $b^{nm}=b^n+b^m$

<br/>

As the previous question. Statement 1 satifisfies the rule for exponentiation of exponentiation.
