### 1.1.14

Design an algorithm that takes an integer value $N$ as argument and returns the largest integer not larger than the base-2 logarithm of $N$ ($log_2(N)$). Do not use a math library.

#### Note: 
the base-2 logarithm of a number is the exponent to which 2 must be raised to obtain that number. Denoted as $log_2(x)$, where $x$ is the number for which you want to find the logarithm. in mathematical notation:

$$
log_2(n)=y \leftrightarrow 2^y=x
$$
