# Problem A - Disjoint Sets

Maintain a family of disjoint sets, initially the singletons $ \{0 \} , \{ 1 \} ,\dots, \{ n-1 \}$ under the following operations:

#### 0("query")

The query operation takes two elements $s$ and $t$ and determines if $s$ and $t$ belong to the same set. More Precisely, if $s\in S$ and $t\in T$ then print "1" if $S=T$ and print "0" if $S\not = T$

#### 1("union")

#### 2("move")
